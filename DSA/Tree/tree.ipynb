    "In Python, a tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. It is used to represent data with a parent-child relationship. A tree structure has several properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "Root: The top node in a tree. It does not have a parent node.\n",
    "Nodes: Each element in the tree that contains data.\n",
    "Edges: The connections between nodes.\n",
    "Parent-Child Relationship: A parent node has one or more child nodes, and each child node has only one parent.\n",
    "Leaf Node: A node that has no children (i.e., the end nodes).\n",
    "Subtree: A tree formed by a node and all its descendants.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Basic Terminology:\n",
    "Root: The starting point of the tree, which has no parent.\n",
    "Parent: A node that has one or more children.\n",
    "Child: A node that is the descendant of another node (its parent).\n",
    "Leaf: A node with no children.\n",
    "Depth: The level of a node in the tree (the root is at level 0).\n",
    "Height: The number of edges on the longest path from a node to a leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Types of Trees:\n",
    "Binary Tree: Each node has at most two children (left and right).\n",
    "Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree where the left child’s value is less than its parent node, and the right child’s value is greater than its parent node.\n",
    "AVL Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree where the difference in heights of left and right subtrees is at most one.\n",
    "Heap: A binary tree used to implement a priority queue. A max-heap has the largest value at the root, and a min-heap has the smallest value at the root.\n",
    "Tree Implementation in Python:\n",
    "You can implement a tree using classes in Python. Here's an example of a simple binary tree:"
